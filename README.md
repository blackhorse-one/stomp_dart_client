# Stomp Dart
This library provides an implementation for a STOMP client connecting to a remote server. 
It should work for both pure dart and flutter.

## Usage

#### Initialize
The client gets created the specified config, 
please see the Config section to see all available options
```dart
StompClient client = StompClient(
    config: StompConfig(
        url: 'wss://yourserver',
        onConnect: onConnectCallback
    )
);
```
The connect callback should be used to make sure that we are actually connected before we subscribe or send messages
```dart
void onConnectCallback(StompClient client, StompFrame connectFrame) {
    // use the client object passed.
}
```

#### Connect
```dart
client.activate();
```

#### Subscribe
```dart
client.subscribe(destination: '/foo/bar', headers: {}, callback: (frame) {
    // Received a frame for this subscription
    print(frame.body);
})
```

#### Unsubscribe
`client.subscribe(...)` returns a function which can be called with an optional map of headers
```dart
dynamic unsubscribeFn = client.subscribe(destination: '/foo/bar', headers: {}, callback: (frame) {
    // Received a frame for this subscription
    print(frame.body);
})
...
unsubscribeFn(unsubscribeHeaders: {});
```

#### Send
```dart
client.send(desintation: '/foo/bar', body: 'Your message body', headers: {});
```

#### Disconnect
```dart
client.deactivate();
```

| onStompError: Function(StompFrame)           | Function to be called when the stomp server sends an error frame                                           |
| onUnhandledFrame: Function(StompFrame)       | Function to be called when the server sends a unrecognized frame                                           |

## Development

#### Running unit tests
```dart
pub run test test/
```

#### Generating coverage data
```dart
pub global activate coverage
pub global run coverage:collect_coverage --port=8111 --out=coverage.json --wait-paused --resume-isolates & dart --disable-service-auth-codes --enable-vm-service=8111 --pause-isolates-on-exit test/test_all.dart
```
And to convert to lcov
```dart
pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage.json --out=lcov.info --packages=.packages --report-on=lib
```
